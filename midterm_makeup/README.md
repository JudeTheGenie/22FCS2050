# Instructions

This make-up is **optional** but highly encouraged if you got less than 50% in the exam. It can increase your midterm grade up to 20%. For that, you are asked to finish all TO-DOs embedded in the provided code (7 in total). Midterm increase will be distributed according to the following rubric: 

+1 // TODO #1: override equals in Marathoner such that it returns true if marathoners have the same name.
+1 // TODO #2: override compareTo in Marathoner such that female marathoners appear before male marathoners and that faster marathoners appear before slower ones (if they have the same gender).
+2 // TODO #3: Consider the definition of a MarathonersList class from LinkedList<Marathoner>. Then implement the following method that returns a new MarathonersList by filtering the (callee) MarathonersList based on the given gender.
+3 // TODO #4: Still in MarathonersList, implement the following method that returns the faster marathoner based on the given gender.
+1 // TODO #5: declare a static array of Marathoner's named "mrts" and then instantiate the array with size 5, saving the reference into "mrts".
+1 // TODO #6:  instantiate a MarathonersList and add (or append) all the marathoners (described in the MarathonersDriver class); then display a list of the male marathoners followed by female marathoners using MarathonersList's byGender method; finally, show the faster male and female marathoner using MarathonersList's getFaster method.
+1 // TODO #7: The series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... is called the harmonic series. Finish the implementation of the recursive function below that computes the harmonic series (the sum) given the order number n, starting at 1.
total: +10

# Submission

Zip the following source codes into src.zip: 

* Marathoner.java
